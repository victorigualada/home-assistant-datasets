Click **Create Automation** and select **Humidity-Controlled Fan**.\n4.

Save the automation.\n\n---\n### **How It Works**\n- The automation triggers when the humidity sensor crosses the threshold (either above or below).\n- If humidity **rises above** the threshold, it turns the fan **on** (only if it’s off).\n- If humidity **falls below** the threshold, it turns the fan **off** (only if it’s on).\n- Prevents unnecessary state changes (e.g., won’t turn the fan off if it’s already off).","humidity_fan-test_blueprint_inputs","Good",""
