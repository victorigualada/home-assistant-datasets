    # Light on door

    ## Problem statement

    Create an blueprint automation to turn on a light when the door opens.

    ## Example use cases

    These are example use cases that could be used with the blueprint:

    - Turn on the pantry light when the pantry door opens

    ## Detailed Description

    The blueprint should accept two inputs:

    | Input          | Description                                                                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `door_sensor`  | A `binary_sensor` that triggers the automation to start.                        |
    | `light_switch` | One or more `light` entity targets to turn on or off when the automation fires. |

    The automation should trigger when the door opens, and turn the light on. The
    light should be shut off when the door closes or after a 2 minute timeout.
response: |-
  Here’s a **blueprint automation** for Home Assistant that turns on a light when a door opens and turns it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout:

  ```yaml
  blueprint:
    name: Turn on light when door opens
    description: Turn on a light when a door opens and turn it off when the door closes or after a 2-minute timeout.
    domain: automation
    input:
      door_sensor:
        name: Door Sensor
        description: Binary sensor that triggers the automation (e.g., pantry door sensor).
        selector:
          entity:
            domain: binary_sensor
      light_switch:
        name: Light
        description: Light(s) to turn on/off when the door opens/closes.
        selector:
          target:
            domain: light
      timeout:
        name: Timeout (minutes)
        description: Time to wait before turning off the light if the door remains open.
        default: 2
        selector:
          number:
            min: 1
            max: 60
            unit_of_measurement: minutes

  mode: restart
  max_exceeded: silent

  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: !input door_sensor
      to: "on"  # Door opens

  action:
    - service: light.turn_on
      target: !input light_switch

    - wait_for_trigger:
        - platform: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          to: "off"  # Door closes
        - platform: state
          entity_id: !input door_sensor
          to: "on"  # Door re-opens (restarts automation)
          for: !input timeout  # Timeout if door stays open
      timeout: !input timeout
      continue_on_timeout: true

    - service: light.turn_off
      target: !input light_switch
  ```

  ---

  ### **How It Works**:
  1. **Trigger**: The automation starts when the `door_sensor` (e.g., pantry door) opens (`state: "on"`).
  2. **Action**:
     - Turns on the `light_switch` (e.g., pantry light).
     - Waits for one of two events:
       - The door closes (`state: "off"`), **or**
       - A 2-minute timeout (adjustable) if the door stays open.
  3. **Result**: The light turns off when the door closes or after the timeout.

  ---

  ### **How to Use**:
  1. Save this blueprint in your Home Assistant `blueprints/automation/` folder (e.g., `door_light_blueprint.yaml`).
  2. Create a new automation using the blueprint and select:
     - The door sensor (e.g., `binary_sensor.pantry_door`).
     - The light(s) to control (e.g., `light.pantry_light`).
  3. Adjust the timeout if needed.

          You are a voice assistant for Home Assistant.
          Answer questions about the world truthfully.
          Answer in plain text. Keep it simple and to the point.
          When controlling Home Assistant always call the intent tools. Use HassTurnOn to lock and HassTurnOff to unlock a lock. When controlling a device, prefer passing just name and domain. When controlling an area, prefer passing just area name and domain.
          When a user asks to turn on all devices of a specific type, ask user to specify an area, unless there is only one device of that type.
          This device is not able to start timers.
          You ARE equipped to answer questions about the current state of
          the home using the `GetLiveContext` tool. This is a primary function. Do not state you lack the
          functionality if the question requires live data.
          If the user asks about device existence/type (e.g., "Do I have lights in the bedroom?"): Answer
          from the static context below.
          If the user asks about the CURRENT state, value, or mode (e.g., "Is the lock locked?",
          "Is the fan on?", "What mode is the thermostat in?", "What is the temperature outside?"):
              1.  Recognize this requires live data.
              2.  You MUST call `GetLiveContext`. This tool will provide the needed real-time information (like temperature from the local weather, lock status, etc.).
              3.  Use the tool's response** to answer the user accurately (e.g., "The temperature outside is [value from tool].").
          For general knowledge questions not about the home: Answer truthfully from internal knowledge.
